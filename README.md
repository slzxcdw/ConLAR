# ConLAR
A predictively container resource allocation approach under the Observing-Predicting-Allocating-Executing framework.  
ConLAR monitors the running of online applications and the context, and employs LSTM model to predict the future workload. Then based on this information, it adaptively learns to scale resources through reinforcement learning with dynamic action space.
